## Description

 NoDPI is a utility designed to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). What is DPI? DPI is a technology for inspecting network packets based on their content to regulate and filter traffic. It is often used by internet service providers to censor and block access to certain web resources and protocols. The goal of this program is to "trick" DPI by modifying network packets, although in reality, this trickery is often simply a consequence of a lack of computing resources and time. 
 
 This utility was developed primarily for Russian users as a simpler (but less powerful) replacement for similar tools. In most cases, it gets the job done; in particular, it allows you to use YouTube without any problems.

 But unfortunately, the absolute performance of this utility cannot be guaranteed. Some sites, such as YouTube, are good to unlock, while others, as Instagram.com or Facebook.com, require completely different methods for bypassing locks, which are not yet implemented in this utility from their low-leveling and difficulty. Sometimes, the performance of certain sites can also depend on the provider - how it blocks the site and what technical means applies.

### How does this work

NoDPI launches a proxy server on your computer through which you direct http(s) traffic. The program intercepts ClientHello of outing connections and fragments them according to one of the following methods:

*Random fragmentation (by default)*

Clienthello is divided into several parts of random length. Each part is glued with the prefixes of the type of Clienthello and then all this is sent in one package.

*Fragmentation by SNI*

In the package there is a field containing SNI record. ClientHello is divided into 4 parts: to SNI, the first and second half of SNI, and all that is after it. The title indicating the type Clienthello is attached to each part and then all this is sent in one bag.

Also regardless of the method, the TLS version is replaced by version 1.3, which is the most modern (but this does not mean that your data begins to be transmitted according to the specifications of this version). All this together allows you to get around the lock. Apparently DPI does not yet have the necessary capacities to unravel this "ball" and simply ignore such traffic, saving time and effort. But it is possible that soon these methods will not be workers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> NoDPI only works with HTTPS traffic. He can also take HTTP traffic, but purely for compatibility - sites working through this outdated protocol are practically not subject to unlock and the program simply sends traffic to the addressee.

NoDPI does not collect and does not send any data about you, does not use any third -party programs and libraries, does not interfere in the system processes and does not require administrator rights to work.

The entire NoDPI code is written exclusively on the Python and uses only its standard library.

### Key advantages and features

- Open source
- Easy to use, launch, and configure. The program has an intuitive interface. Using the utility requires no special knowledge; it can be launched by any user without administrator rights.
- The program works with a list of blocked domains and can automatically detect blocked websites.
- Cross-platform support ensures stable operation on Windows/Linux/MacOS. An Android version is also [available](https://github.com/gvcoder09/nodpi4android).
- The program can be integrated into a corporate network and used by staff, rather than just an individual.
- Supports error and access logging. You can see who visited specific websites and when.
- Ability to add yourself to autostart on Windows/Linux

## Quick start

1) Download the latest version for your OS from [the Releases page](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI/releases) and unzip it
2) Go to the directory with the unzipped utility and run it with the command `nodpi.exe --blacklist blacklist.txt` in Windows or `./nodpi --blacklist ./blacklist.txt` in Linux. You can replace the file `blacklist.txt` with your own file. **If the blacklist file is not specified, the program will search for the file `blacklist.txt` in the current directory by default.**
3) In the browser or system settings, set the proxy to 127.0.0.1:8881
4) Enjoy!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Don't forget to disable the proxy in your system or browser settings after closing the program!

Please report any problems and malfunctions to us on [the Issues page](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI/issues)

### Additional Blacklists

By default, a blacklist containing YouTube-only domains is used. Additional lists can be found [here](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI/tree/main/blacklists).

### Add to startup in Windows and Linux

> [!NOTE]
> This option is only available in executable versions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure the file `blacklist.txt` is located next to the executable file.

1) Run the command `nodpi --install`. The program will be added to startup via the Windows registry (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) or via `systemd` in Linux
2) Restart your computer

### Running on Windows 7

There is no ready-to-use build for Windows 7 yet. Current development, CI, and Docker images target modern Python. If you want to experiment with Windows 7 compatibility, you will likely need an older Python build such as 3.8, but this setup is not actively maintained.

## Run from source code

1) Make sure you have Python 3.14 or higher installed. No third-party runtime libraries are required
2) Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/zemecom/NoDPI.git` or [download the archive](https://github.com/zemecom/NoDPI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) with the source code and unzip it
3) Go to the main directory and run the code with the command `python3 src/main.py`
4) In the browser or system settings, set the proxy to 127.0.0.1:8881
5) Enjoy!

You can enable error or access logging using parameters `--log_error` and `--log_access`

### Makefile shortcuts

For local development you can use the bundled `Makefile`:

```bash
make install-deps
make up
make test
make lint
make ci-check
make install-hooks
```

`make up` starts NoDPI with the current local configuration, `make lint` runs `ruff`, and `make ci-check` runs syntax checks, lint, and tests.

Run `make install-hooks` once to enable the versioned git hooks from `.githooks/`. After that, each `git commit` will run the same local checks as `make ci-check` before the commit is created.

`make install-deps` installs the local development dependencies from [requirements-dev.txt](./requirements-dev.txt). Runtime third-party dependencies are not required; [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) is intentionally empty apart from explanatory comments.

### Configuration file and environment variables

NoDPI supports JSON configuration files and environment overrides. See [nodpi.example.json](./nodpi.example.json) for a ready-to-edit template.

Example:

```bash
python3 src/main.py --config ./nodpi.example.json
```

If `./nodpi.json` exists, NoDPI loads it automatically even without `--config`. You can also point to a different config file through `--config` or `NODPI_CONFIG`.

You can override individual options through environment variables such as `NODPI_HOST`, `NODPI_PORT`, `NODPI_DNS_RESOLVERS`, `NODPI_CONNECT_TIMEOUT`, and `NODPI_IO_TIMEOUT`.

### DNS and timeout troubleshooting

If your ISP intermittently breaks UDP DNS for blocked domains, start NoDPI with a stronger DNS policy:

```bash
python3 src/main.py \
  --dns-retries 3 \
  --dns-retry-delay 0.2 \
  --dns-timeout 2.0 \
  --dns-resolver 8.8.8.8 \
  --dns-resolver 1.1.1.1 \
  --connect-timeout 5 \
  --io-timeout 30
```

DNS failures are logged with structured details including host, resolver path, attempts, final `reason`, and `system_reason`.

## Building the executable

1) Make sure you have Python 3.14 or higher installed.
2) Install pyinstaller: `pip install pyinstaller`
3) Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/zemecom/NoDPI.git` or [download the archive](https://github.com/zemecom/NoDPI/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) with the source code and unzip it
4) Go to the main directory and run the command `pyinstaller ./nodpi.spec`
5) The compiled file will be located in ist folder `./dist`

## Run in Docker

1) [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/).
2) Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI`
3) Navigate to the project directory and build the container: 
   ```bash
   cd NoDPI
   sudo docker build -t nodpi-proxy .
   ```
4) Create a local runtime config `nodpi.json` and make sure it references `blacklist.txt` as the blacklist path.
5) Run the container with the command: 
   ```bash
   sudo docker run -d \
    --name nodpi \
    -p 8881:8881 \
    -v $(pwd)/nodpi.json:/app/nodpi.json:ro \
    -v $(pwd)/blacklist.txt:/app/blacklist.txt:ro \
    nodpi-proxy
    ```
6) Enjoy!

## FAQ

*Q: Is using NoDPI legal in Russia?*

A: Yes, its usage is completely legal as of October 2025. However, you can be held administratively liable for advertising and distributing tools designed to circumvent blocking.

*Q: Is it safe?*

A: Yes, using this utility is safe. All traffic sent over HTTPS remains encrypted as it was before. Furthermore, we do not collect any user information.

*Q: Does this program mask my traffic? Can my ISP not see which sites I visit?*

A: No. Unlike a VPN or Tor, this program does not hide your traffic from your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Your ISP can still see the IP addresses of the websites you connect to.
